Portable_Sloan_List.py is a python script which creates a ‘MASTER’ directory wherever the code was implemented.  It searches the iras.pac SWS ATLAS database for the objects in Sloan_List_RA_DEC.txt and produces a number of plots of interest.  The objects are then sorted in the master directory depending upon it’s type of spectra.

It requires python, numpy, scipy, and selenium webdriver to be installed prior to running.
